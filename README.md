# Cisco Packet Tracer - Small Network

## Description

Cisco packet tracer is a networking simulation tool used to simulate and practice networking topics. In this project, I simulate the network of a small business that consists of three departments: human resources, marketing, and sales. I utilize various networking protocols and fundamentals to successfully route traffic
to and from end devices. Some of these protocols and fundamentals include router-rip, ssh, inter-vlan routing, trunk/access ports, and more.
